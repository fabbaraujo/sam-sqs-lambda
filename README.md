# sam-sqs-lambda

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) command line interface (CLI). It includes the following files and folders:

- `src` - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- `events` - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- `__tests__` - Unit tests for the application code. 
- `template.yml` - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

Resources for this project are defined in the `template.yml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.

If you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to build and test your application, you can use the AWS Toolkit.  
The AWS Toolkit is an open-source plugin for popular IDEs that uses the AWS SAM CLI to build and deploy serverless applications on AWS. The AWS Toolkit also adds step-through debugging for Lambda function code.

## Use the AWS SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application by using the `sam build` command.

```bash
my-application$ sam build
```

The AWS SAM CLI installs dependencies that are defined in `package.json`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
my-application$ sam local invoke -e events/sqs-event.json
```

Generate new event.

```bash
my-application$ sam local generate-event sqs receive-message > sqs-event.json
```


## Add a resource to your application

The application template uses AWS SAM to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources, such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources that aren't included in the [AWS SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use the standard [AWS CloudFormation resource types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html).

Update `template.yml` to add a dead-letter queue to your application. In the **Resources** section, add a resource named **MyQueue** with the type **AWS::SQS::Queue**. Then add a property to the **AWS::Serverless::Function** resource named **DeadLetterQueue** that targets the queue's Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and a policy that grants the function permission to access the queue.

```
Resources:
  SimpleQueue:
    Type: AWS::SQS::Queue
  SQSPayloadLogger:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: src/lambda.handler
      Runtime: nodejs14.x
      DeadLetterQueue:
        Type: SQS
        TargetArn: !GetAtt SimpleQueue.Arn
      Policies:
        - SQSSendMessagePolicy:
            QueueName: !GetAtt SimpleQueue.QueueName
```

The dead-letter queue is a location for Lambda to send events that could not be processed. It's only used if you invoke your function asynchronously, but it's useful here to show how you can modify your application's resources and function configuration.

## Unit tests

Tests are defined in the `__tests__` folder in this project. Use `npm` to install the [Jest test framework](https://jestjs.io/) and run unit tests.

```bash
my-application$ npm install
my-application$ npm run test
```

## DynamoDB

Run docker-compose.

```bash
my-application$ docker-compose up
```

Create database in Localstack.

```bash
my-application$ aws dynamodb create-table --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 --table-name TableTest --attribute-definitions "AttributeName=pk,AttributeType=S" "AttributeName=sk,AttributeType=S" --key-schema "AttributeName=pk,KeyType=HASH" "AttributeName=sk,KeyType=RANGE" --provisioned-throughput "ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5"
```

Scan table database.

```bash
my-application$ aws dynamodb scan --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 --table-name TableTest
```
